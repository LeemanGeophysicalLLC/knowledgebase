As soon as the unit receives power, the large ring will begin to light up green. This is the calibration procedure of the compass to compensate for any magnetic materials in the area and is done each time the unit is turned on. During this time rotate the compass and tilt it in all directions. Be sure to get upside down too! Once the ring is completely green, the calibration is complete. The rings will then turn blue and red. If the compass is inaccurate try moving further from magnetic interference and recalibrating the compass. Recalibration can be done by pressing the reset button on the Red Board or by unplugging and replugging the USB cable.</p> <p>The leds turn from blue to red as they get closer to the direction of the magnetic field vector. The large ring indicates the direction of north while the smaller ring shows how much the magnetic field is dipping at your location. Be sure to check out the maps of magnetic dip and see how your readings compare!</p> <p>If you plug the compass into a computer you might notice the green led calibration process restart a couple of times while the computer is opening a serial connection to the compass. You can use a program like the Arduino IDE (freely downloaded from the Arduino.cc website) to open a serial monitor and view the data from the magnetometer!

Brittle deformation occurs in the cold upper crust where rocks are squeezed and store energy like springs. They keep storing more and more energy until they fail and break. This is the mode of deformation associated with things like earthquakes. Ductile deformation on the other hand is the slow movement of material, often associated with hot rocks under extreme pressures deep within the planet. Creep deformation is associated with tectonic scale deformation, flow of the Earth\u2019s mantle, and more.  </p> <p>There are even different styles of creep such as diffusion and dislocation creep. Diffusion creep is generally associated with higher temperature deformation and is the movement of vacancies in a crystal\u2019s structure through the material. Dislocation creep is the movement of a dislocation or imperfection in the crystal and generally is the dominant type of creep at lower temperatures. Dislocation creep doesn\u2019t depend on the grain size of the material, but diffusion creep does.  </p> <p>Since different materials melt at different temperatures, we talk about how \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d the temperature is relative to the melting point of the material. The ratio of the current temperature of the material to its melting point is called the homologous temperature.  </p> \\[T_H = {T(K) \\over T_mp(K)}\\] <p>Similarly, we often do not want to worry about the absolute length of a sample, but we care much more about its change in length relative to its size. For example, shortening a football field by a meter would hardly be noticeable, but shortening your desk by a meter would be! To describe length change relative to the size of something, scientists use a quantity called strain. Strain is defined as the change in length divided by the initial length. The strain rate is the change in strain over time. For example a sample that was at a strain of 0.01 initially, then at 0.06 after 10 minutes would be experiencing a strain rate of 0.005 strain/minute.  </p> <p>Dislocation creep is described as a \u201cpower law\u201d relationship, meaning that it works in a non-linear way. It relates the strain rate of a material under a load to the stress and material/physical properties through the use of a \u201cstress exponent\u201d.  </p> \\[\\dot\\epsilon=A\\sigma^mexp({-Q_c \\over RT})\\] <p>There are several types of tests that we can run on a material - they involve different imposed sets of loading conditions called boundary conditions. We can either apply a constant load to a sample and see how it deforms and creeps under that load, or we can apply a constant crushing motion to the sample (called a constant displacement or constant strain rate) and measure the force that results from that. Both tests should produce the same results, but due to the properties of materials certain types of tests are often easier to perform on certain materials. We will be using the constant load test, often referred to as a \u201cdead weight\u201d test since we apply a given load and leave it there for the duration of the test.  </p> <p>Assuming that the temperature, materials, and load remain constant we expect to see a sample strain in a predictable way over time. First, the sample loads elastically, like a spring. This is recoverable deformation - if you remove the weight, the sample springs back. Next the curve becomes more shallow in the transient state. In this state deformation is becoming permanent as creep begins. Finally, the curve reaches a constant slope. The sample strain rate is constant and this represents the steady-state creep of the material.</p>"},{"location":"Creep_Deformation_Apparatus/creep_deformation_apparatus/#lab-activity","title":"Lab Activity","text":"<ul> <li>Google Docs Lab Activity</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Creep_Deformation_Apparatus/creep_deformation_apparatus/#software","title":"Software","text":"<ul> <li>Desktop Software Installer</li> <li>Desktop Software Code (open source!)</li> <li>Arduino Code (open source!)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Creep_Deformation_Apparatus/creep_deformation_apparatus/#accessories","title":"Accessories","text":""},{"location":"Creep_Deformation_Apparatus/creep_deformation_apparatus/#wax-core-packs-2-0000262","title":"Wax Core Packs (2-0000262)","text":"<p>A pack of 10 wax cores for use with our Creep Deformation Apparatus in the classroom!

If the readings are different     than expected alignment is necessary.

Geologists can look at rocks in the field today and learn about what the Earth was like millions of years ago (or more!). Over millions of years rocks are pushed around and deform (bend or break) in many different ways. The squeeze box is a tool that lets you recreate millions of years of geologic deformation in just a few minutes! The processes that you can observe in real rocks can be observed in the squeeze box - in fact tools like this are what scientists use to try to understand how geology works in the first place!  </p> <p>We say that the squeeze box is an \u201canalog model\u201d - it is similar to (an analog) the deformation of real rocks, but it is a model because it is not real rocks being deformed by the Earth over millions of years. Since we don\u2019t have millions of years to sit around and watch the rocks, this analog model is a good tool to try to understand how the rocks deform over geologic time.  </p> <p>So what can bend and break rocks in the first place? More rocks! The Earth\u2019s crust, or outer layer of rock, is made up of large blocks of rock called tectonic plates. These plates are moved around thanks to heat from inside the Earth. In fact they move about the rate your hair or fingernails grow! These plates crash into each other, though very slowly, and create massive pressures. The rocks between the plates get squeezed so hard that they eventually must deform. Some bend and form arcs that geologists call folds while others break and slide creating faults. We call movement on these faults earthquakes and they are very common at plate boundaries such as in Japan, New Zealand, or the west coast of North and South America.  </p> <p>As always, when conducting a science experiment, safety comes first! Wear safety glasses to keep any sand out of your eyes and make sure you have an adult to help you if needed.

The system was designed by Leeman Geophysical LLC in 2022 and released in 2023 as an open standard. The design goal was simple - to eliminate the technical challenges faced by scientists and industrial integrators when creating solutions to basic data acquisition and control problems. All too often we see the problem of `I need to measure and record the output of this load cell and displacement transducer' solved with $5000 of very nice, but greatly over specified data acquisition systems sold on the market today.</p> <p>The truth of the matter is, all systems in the end convert a physical measurement to a voltage. That voltage is then measured and recorded. The transformation from physical to voltage happens as a combination of the transducer technology chosen and the signal conditioning required to turn the transducer output into a signal of the proper range. SMPL provides building blocks to work with sensors and actuators of many forms, but reducing them to raw voltages going across standard connectors. This means a simple voltage input/output data acquisition system may be used to interface to practically any instrument without the need for specialized and expensive proprietary DAQ system components. SMPL is data acquisition system agnostic. It can be used with anything from a volt meter to a paper strip chart recorder to a high frequency and high bit depth precision analog to digital converter.</p> <p>With the building block nature of the SMPL components, a simple block diagram drawing of your system almost directly converts into a purchasing list and hookup diagram. This saves time in design and lets your system build on the years of experience our team has interfacing with sensors in applications ranging from livestock monitoring to grain bin assessment to rock mechanics apparatus.</p>"},{"location":"SMPL/smpl/#who-is-smpl-for","title":"Who is SMPL For?","text":"<p>In short, everyone who doesn't want to waste time dealing with the minutia of interfacing to their transducers. SMPL was designed with research and development laboratories in mind as often during the course of R&amp;D the exact system needed is not a well defined problem as it is in many more traditional engineering projects. Maybe the load or displacement of the system is less than expected and more gain is needed, maybe the analog to digital converter left from a previous project has a different voltage range than the instrumentation available, or maybe you need 4 sensors instead of 2. SMPL makes all of that simple!</p> <p>The modular nature of SMPL makes it easy to expand, remix, reuse, and alter on the fly. SMPL is the nuts and bolts of the electronic data acquisition world. Keeping some cables, modules, and a smattering of transducers in the lab means you can rapidly test hypotheses and build a system that grows with your research ambitions and ideas.</p> <p>SMPL isn't only for the laboratory though. It can be an economical choice for industrial control and monitoring applications. Industrial measurement applications often go through many iterations as the plant equipment is changed, new requirements present themselves, or technologies evolve. The modular nature of SMPL also makes maintenance easy as technicians can swap modules as opposed to spending time troubleshooting large complex blocks. Downtime can be reduced by swapping the easily identifiable SMPL modules pushing the troubleshooting to offline times while the plant is back up and running.</p>"},{"location":"SMPL/smpl/#dont-see-what-you-need","title":"Don't See What you Need?","text":"<p>Maybe you've looked through the book, but are not finding something that helps with your problem.

When rocks slide past each other, they can either move smoothly or they can move in a stop-start \u201csticky\u201d fashion. Smooth movement means that that plate boundary does not store energy and is not prone to earthquakes. Stick- slip movement, on the other hand, stores energy in the rocks through their elastic properties and can result in earthquakes.</p> <p>We call the boundary where the earthquake occurs a fault - or a boundary on which the slip of an earthquake occurs. The rock surrounding the fault is often called \u201ccountry rock\u201d and is the rock that gets stretched or compressed by plate movement to store energy for an earthquake. Think of this process as stretching a rubber band - and eventually the rubber band cannot stretch any further and fails, releasing that stored energy in a sudden fashion.  </p> <p>To learn more about how faults work, and what can determine if a given fault is prone to earthquakes or to smoothly slipping, scientists needed to create a simple model. The simplest model of the system is called the \u201cspring-slider\u201d and is what we\u2019ll be using to explore the physics of earthquakes.  </p> <p>In our simplified model, there is a base plate representing one side of the fault and a slider that repre- sents the other side of the fault. A motor pulls the slider across the base plate, putting energy into the system just like the driving forces of plate tectonics. We use a spring to represent the elasticity of the rocks that store up energy for an earthquake. By changing the spring we can simulate different rocks (some are more squishy than others), by changing the speed of the motor we can change the simulated loading rate from plate movement, by changing the load on the slider we can simulate pore pressures/different normal loads, and by changing the interface material we can simulate different rock frictional properties. Thanks to the decades of rock mechanics studies, done by friction researchers, seismologists, and physicists, we know that there are MANY factors that determine how a given fault is going to behave. These factors include: rock stiffness, frictional properties of the rock, fluid in the fault, pressures in the fault, loading rate, temperature, and more! In labs around the world researchers are studying each of these and working to develop more advanced models to better understand faults.  </p> <p>When faults are unstable (prone to having earthquakes), they generally have repeating earthquakes as part of the earthquake cycle. During this cycle the rocks are stretched and loaded for some time. The stiffness of the rocks is represented by the slope of the displacement-stress line. When the fault cannot take any more load, failure occurs and the fault moves for some slip duration that is much shorter than the loading time. During the failure, energy is released resulting in a stress drop on the system. The process then repeats over and over again at some recurrence time interval.</p> <p>Real earthquakes may take hundreds or thousands of years to accumulate the energy that they release in only a few minutes. Earthquakes can also be triggered by other earthquakes, changes in water pressure on the fault, or a host of other factors.  </p>"},{"location":"Spring_Slider_Earthquake_Machine/spring_slider_earthquake_machine/#lab-activities","title":"Lab Activities","text":"<p>In this lab, you\u2019ll explore the role of a few variables on the earthquake cycle of a spring-slider model.

This circuit utilizes some clever analog design tricks to do this with no programming and no computer. In this case, there are a total of 6 operation amplifiers (Op-Amps) serving to generate a sign wave, buffer it, and read the signal with a comparator to produce an alternating output to activate the two lights. Op-Amps are a versatile component used in many electronics. Simply by changing the configuration of the components and connections around the op-amp, you can drastically alter its function. Although there are many simpler ways to configure the LEDs to blink in this way, this circuit serves as a demonstration of the diverse utility of op-amps, and provides test points to aid in the study of the signal chain for educational purposes. In the first stage of the blinky PCB (Function Generation), an op-amp creates a sine wave through an old but effective circuit called an RC Phase shift Oscillator. Popular in many fields of electronics, this chunk of the circuit works by creating a regenerative feedback loop. It utilizes a network comprised of resistors and capacitors to create a phase shift in the signal. This is a type of intentional interference that creates an oscillation. The op-amp in the loop serves to boost the signal so that it does not dissipate over time, which in turn maintains a constant amplitude. After this sine wave is generated, it is fed into another op-amp which is configured as a voltage follower, or buffer. The buffer that the signal is fed into serves to take in external power and uses it to fortify the signal. Using a buffer between a signal and its destination ensures that the current draw on the signal cannot alter it. The other voltage follower in this circuit serves to buffer the 4.5V coming out of the 10k voltage divider. As voltage is simply a measure of difference in charge between two points, the middle point of the 9V battery can be called 0V or ground, and we can call the positive terminal of the battery 4.5VDC in reference to our virtual ground. The negative terminal in this configuration would then become -4.5VDC. These power rails are then used to power all the other op-amps in the circuit. Continuing on down the signal chain, the signal is finally fed into two op-amps which together act as a comparator. When there is no feedback loop from an op-amps output to its input, the output fully saturates to the positive power rail as long as the positive input is greater than the negative input. So, with the negative input of one of our op-amps, and the positive of the other both referenced to our virtual ground (the sine waves midpoint), we feed the signal into the remaining inputs. As the signal rises above the midpoint, the op-amp with the signal fed to the positive input will saturate, which will activate its LED. As the signal dips below the midpoint, the output of the amplifier with the signal connected to the negative terminal will turn on. This creates an alternating blinking pattern at the frequency of the sine wave generated at the beginning of the circuit.  </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Waveform_Blinky/waveform_blinky/#revision-history","title":"Revision History","text":"Date Changes August 2024 Initial Release"},{"location":"appnotes/AN0001/","title":"AN0001: Using a Tiltmeter as a Precision Level","text":"<p>Your tiltmeter may be used to level a surface very precisely - often required for setting up optical tables and other precision equipment.

Counts refers to the raw output of the analog to digital converter in the system and is the lowest level form of the measurement. This reading is provided as it allows ultimate versatility in processing because you always begin with data is the purest form. Some instruments, generally our lower resolution MEMS based instruments, will also provide an output in degrees or microradians which uses the stock nominal calibration of the instrument. If you wish to apply an instrument specific calibration or perform other corrections, starting with the raw count reading is best.</p> <p>Counts are always an integer number and represent the voltage output of the sensor as measured by the analog to digital converter. High resolution converters have a wider range of counts that they can divide the measurement range into. For example a 16-bit ADC can output the numbers 0 - 65,535 while a 24-bit ADC can output 0 - 16,777,216.</p> <p>Your instrument will have an expected or nominal calibration that is the mathematical ideal calibration for a perfect instrument. For example, a MEMS inclinometer may have an expected calibration of 0.00179 degrees/count. Therefore if the output of the instrument is 16,435 counts we can convert to degrees by multiplying. We obtain a result of 29.41865 degrees.</p> <pre>\n    Angle = Counts x Calibration\n  </pre> <p>If your instrument had a full custom calibration or you have performed a calibration you may have a different number to use other than the nominal.

A MEMS calibrated once installed in its casing and operating at a temperature for performance in a geothermal well may have a calibration of 0.00182 degrees/count instead of the 0.00179 degrees per count nominal for example. It is very likely that the calibration factor is a function of temperature and depending upon the application this may need to be considered.</p> <p>Using raw counts also allows you to fully document every step of the analysis process - from what calibration was used to any temperature, cross axis, bias, or other corrections are performed on the data.
